# AML-Final-Project

This is the work of Garrett Sooter, Brandon Pover, Soumi Basu, Jesper Li, and Prashanti Kodi

This was completed for our class Advanced Machin Learning for the U Texas MSBA program. 

This is the code we used to attempt to predict returns of the S&P index fund "SPY"

Included you will find a few things

1. 2 scripts we used for preprocessing and data cleaning
2. 1 script which worked as a jumping off point this includes a logistic regression and a SVM
3. Script which runs and optimizes a BNN
4. Various scripts to run LSTM with differnet hyperparametors and data
5. Various scripts used in assessing the preformance of our portfolios
6. We have also included many data files which are used in various steps. 
      i. We have not included all of our data files because many were to big for github.  
      ii. these should be enough to run much of the needed code inorder to try to replicate our results.  
      iii. We have also included all of our cleaning code so you can reproduce if you choose to pull from WRDS/CRSP.
